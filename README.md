# Hacks-for-Humanity-2017

I was part of a team called 'Dunces to Dragons' which built a service (app and website based) called "Each One Teach One" that aims to connect high school and college students to tutors within their area and encourage face-to-face meetings at mutually convenient locations and timings. Tutors are fellow classmates, or peers who have already taken the same course.

I did not contribute to any of the coding efforts, and instead worked on parts of the business plan, project summary, presentation, gathering video and audio. 

The Team placed fourth out of thirteen teams at the Fourth Annual "Hacks for Humanity" event held from October 7-8, 2017 at ASU Tempe. 

Dunces to Dragons consists of Anthony Nicholas, Summer Gautier, Jacob Robinson, myself, and Julia Cannon. 

Anthony Nicholas @AnthonyNicholas designed the entire iOS app https://github.com/AnthonyNicholas/DuncesToDragons

Summer Gautier @SummerGautier designed the entire website. The post-hackathon version also included back-end functionality.
